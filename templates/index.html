        Jayce finds himself back within the old house’s enclosure, its abandoned
        walls disguised as plain brick. The moon hangs bright in the sky,
        casting its light over the scenery. Everything is just like the image
        etched into his memory, except for one detail: This time, the stone is
        covered in a thousand closed eyes.
      </p>
      <p>“Okay, wrap it up!” an agent calls from across the yard.</p>

        Jayce finds himself back within the old house’s enclosure, its abandoned
        walls disguised as plain brick. The moon hangs bright in the sky,
        casting its light over the scenery. Everything is just like the image
        etched into his memory, except for one detail: This time, the stone is
        covered in a thousand closed eyes.
      </p>
      <p>“Okay, wrap it up!” an agent calls from across the yard.</p>
      <p>
        As the midnight air bites at his neck, he feels youth settle into his
        twenty-eight-year-old body—back when the only signs of age were the
        smile lines at his mouth, when the world seemed unprepared for him, when
        his skills felt sufficient and he still believed himself intelligent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tonight, that belief has teeth. The aberration is neutralized and the
        case is closing. His shoulders, for once, are light. It’s time to go
        home.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Come on, Jayce. This is probably going to be my only chance to get him
        alone.” Amaranthine’s voice rings out, and he turns to look at her, the
        sight feels like a stab on his chest.
      </p>
      <p>
        He fears he may be starting to forget her face, but the night terrors
        manage to preserve every detail, from the baby fat that hung in her
        cheeks to the mischievous smirk she always wore. His too-young,
        too-ingenuous protégée, the one he was meant to always look after.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if it’s only a dream, he feels his own mind regressing. He can’t
        remember what made him agree to let her go—perhaps the reassurance that
        professor Heimerdinger would be inside to receive her, or maybe the
        excitement that lit her eyes at what might have been her only chance to
        impress him with her investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Either way, he wants to claw at his own throat when he hears his voice
        mutter the response that would haunt him for years to come. He hears it
        as if from outside himself, wants to grab that earlier version of his
        body and shake it, to scream at him to take it back, to say anything
        else. “Just be quick.”
      </p>
      <p>
        She smiles at him, and he releases the warmth of her arm. He watches her
        slip away, her blonde head bobbing as she runs toward the house, right
        before her frame is swallowed by the darkness inside.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jayce waits twenty, maybe twenty-five minutes, too deep in thought to
        notice the cold creeping deeper into the air, then the car radio turns
        on. Or maybe it was always like that. Maybe the signs were there, and he
        simply failed to recognize them. The thought that haunts him echoes in
        the reverie.
      </p>
      <p>
        The device emits a strange sound, broadcasting at an unknown
        frequency—too low to decipher, even for someone like Jayce, a man once
        trained to read signals as if they were a second language. He waits for
        another five minutes. The combination of sudden cold and static noise
        holds him there, motionless. It isn’t until he sees his own breath
        clouding in the frozen air that reality settles in.
      </p>
      <p>
        When he steps out of the car, he is met with black, empty pupils boring
        into his body. The walls have snapped their eyes open and fix him with
        an accusatory stare; for the first time, Jayce is not the observer but
        the observed. He cannot fathom how small he stands before the vast,
        lurking evil.
      </p>
      <p>
        What happens next comes only in fragments, memories his body recalls as
        spasms.
      </p>
      <p>
        When he tries to run inside the house, the door is sealed shut. He sees
        himself slamming against it until it gives, forcing his way in, shouting
        for help—the static rings against his ears, keeping him from realizing
        that everything else around him has gone silent, that every investigator
        who made up the backup will only resurface from the lake as a corpse.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the room, the odor drowns every sense of direction he has, so he
        guides himself by the blackened blood streaking the halls. The putrid
        scent mingles with something ancient, a stench that feels as though the
        zone had somehow slipped beyond God’s reach.
      </p>
      <p>
        He finds the first piece of Amaranthine just two steps inside the living
        room—her foot. It is small, ghostly pale from drained circulation. His
        next moves feel deliberately automatic when he follows the trail deeper
        into the house. A hand. An arm.
      </p>
      <p>
        It all finally stops in a darkened room, when he finds her head. Blonde
        hair clings at the nape where the cut is clean. Her flesh is still
        tender when he gathers what remains of her into his arms, but the warmth
        is gone. The dead eyes stare past him, blood and froth mingling from her
        mouth. Even now, he can read the terror that must have filled her final
        moments.
      </p>
      <p>
        What remains of her forms a deliberate path, leading him to
        Heimerdinger’s decimated corpse.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jayce’s hands are shaking as he pulls her close, trying to give her some
        of the life he no longer wants. When the car radio blares to life—ten
        times louder than before—he finally understands the message it’s trying
        to send: frantic laughter.
      </p>
      <p>
        His eyes snap open just as the scream is about to tear from his throat.
      </p>

          18 Deaths Attributed to Gas Leak in Buffalo, New York
        </h2>
        <p class="newspaper-byline">By Felicia Wickham</p>
        <div class="newspaper-body">
          <p>
            A week has passed since the incident that shook the entire country:
            the sudden death of 18 citizens inside a warehouse located directly
            across from 2147 Glenmoor Avenue.
          </p>
          <p>
            Following an intense wave of media coverage, the local police
            department has retreated its initial claim that the deaths were
            somehow connected to the recent disappearances near Lake Erie. What
            first appeared to be a widening investigation has now concluded with
            the constabulary washing their hands from earlier implications and
            overall responsibility.
          </p>
          <p>
            Public statements regarding the incident have become more
            restrained, and responsibility for further explanations appears to
            have shifted to a higher authority. After a controversial press
            conference, surprisingly led by the Federal Bureau of Investigation
            (FBI), the deaths were attributed to a gas leak originating from the
            abandoned house previously used as a warehouse.
          </p>
          <p>
            In an apparent attempt to dispel secrecy surrounding the event,
            officials described the incident as a failure of proper safety
            protocols, allegedly resulting in a “poisoning” that left many
            victims disoriented and ultimately led to their drowning in the
            lake. Meanwhile, what occurred inside the property remains unclear,
            as the structure was later set on fire, killing an older man—later
            identified as a private detectivev—and a young woman, a
            criminologist, who were reportedly searching for the source of the
            odor.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, we had the opportunity to meet with FBI Director Cassandra
            Kiramman, who is, for the first time, answering any leftover
            questions regarding the tragedy.
          </p>
          <p class="newspaper-qa">
            <span class="newspaper-q">Q:</span> So, it seems to have been a
            difficult week for the agency—
          </p>
          <p class="newspaper-qa">
            <span class="newspaper-a">Kiramman:</span> [Laughs softly] It
            certainly has.
          </p>
          <p class="newspaper-qa">
            <span class="newspaper-q">Q:</span> Let me start with this question:
            Were there any prior warnings about the warehouse conditions?
          </p>
          <p class="newspaper-qa">
            <span class="newspaper-a">Kiramman:</span> There were a few
            complaints from local residents, yes. We are currently reviewing
            maintenance records to determine whether all those concerns were
            formally documented.
          </p>
          <p class="newspaper-qa">
            <span class="newspaper-q">Q:</span> So the claims that those
            involved were cover-up agents attempting to investigate the site are
            true?
          </p>
          <p class="newspaper-qa">
            <span class="newspaper-a">Kiramman:</span> No. [Pauses] At least not
            in the way people are picturing it. Federal involvement was
            procedural. Those allegations are conspiracy-driven claims meant to
            stir public attention.
          </p>
          <p class="newspaper-qa">
            <span class="newspaper-q">Q:</span> Do you deny that the FBI had an
            overall mandate at the scene?
          </p>
          <p class="newspaper-qa">
            <span class="newspaper-a">Kiramman:</span> As I said, federal agents
            were present. Their involvement was based on jurisdictional
            protocol.
          </p>
          <p class="newspaper-qa">
            <span class="newspaper-q">Q:</span> Why send so many agents to
            investigate what was described as a barely documented gas leak?
          </p>
          <p class="newspaper-qa">
            <span class="newspaper-a">Kiramman:</span> The characterization of
            “so many agents” is misleading. Personnel present at the scene came
            from a range of professional backgrounds, including private citizens
            and individuals with prior investigative experience.
          </p>
          <p class="newspaper-qa">
            <span class="newspaper-q">Q:</span> So if—let’s say—an average
            citizen reports an open stove at my house, is that enough to require
            FBI intervention?
          </p>
          <p class="newspaper-qa">
            <span class="newspaper-a">Kiramman:</span> That analogy
            oversimplifies the circumstances. [She shifts on her chain] Federal
            involvement was triggered by jurisdictional and safety protocols
            specific to this case. Attempts to suggest that the presence of
            individuals with prior federal experience indicates a coordinated
            operation are nothing but unfounded rumours that are deeply harmful
            to the families of those involved.
          </p>
          <p class="newspaper-qa">
            <span class="newspaper-q">Q:</span> What made this particular case
            require such delicacy?
          </p>
          <p class="newspaper-qa">
            <span class="newspaper-a">Kiramman:</span> There were previous
            reports indicating the possible presence of hazardous industrial
            compounds inside the property, which is why federal protocols were
            activated. [She interrupts before the next question is fully
            formed.] And because the area is classified as a vacant zone, there
            was no need to issue a public evacuation.
          </p>
          <p class="newspaper-qa">
            <span class="newspaper-q">Q:</span> So this was no mere gas leak,
            correct? Any indication as to how this may have originated?
          </p>
          <p class="newspaper-qa">
            <span class="newspaper-a">Kiramman:</span> We suspect the issue may
            be linked to the prior mismanagement of chemicals stored by the
            previous owner of the warehouse. We have compared the findings with
            earlier inspection reports, which suggest improper storage
            practices.
          </p>
          <p class="newspaper-qa">
            <span class="newspaper-q">Q:</span> Wouldn’t that classify this as a
            coordinated operation, then?
          </p>
          <p class="newspaper-qa">
            <span class="newspaper-a">Kiramman:</span> [Sighs] That
            interpretation stems from ongoing rumors about the supposed “true
            nature” of this case. Several fabricated reports have circulated
            around the community, none have factual basis.
          </p>
          <p class="newspaper-qa">
            <span class="newspaper-q">Q:</span> Can you clarify what kind of
            materials were found inside the house?
          </p>
          <p class="newspaper-qa">
            <span class="newspaper-a">Kiramman:</span> Due to the ongoing review
            and safety considerations, we cannot disclose specific compounds at
            this time.
          </p>
          <p class="newspaper-qa">
            <span class="newspaper-q">Q:</span> It seems you have a very
            confident view of the event.
          </p>
          <p class="newspaper-qa">
            <span class="newspaper-a">Kiramman:</span> It’s my responsibility to
            provide the public with a clear and unbiased account of what is a
            tragic accident. We deeply mourn the loss of everyone involved and
            with all due respect, we ask that this painful chapter not be
            subjected to further speculation. We remain committed to the
            protection of our personnel and the public.
          </p>
          <p class="newspaper-qa">
            <span class="newspaper-q">Q:</span> Before we go, I’d like to ask
            about the sole registered survivor. Will he be making any public
            statements regarding what he saw inside?
          </p>
          <p class="newspaper-qa">
            <span class="newspaper-a">Kiramman:</span> The engineering consultant
            has been placed in a confidential medical facility. You have to
            understand that this would be an extraordinarily traumatic position
            for anyone, we are keeping him in our thoughts and wishing him
            strength during this time.
