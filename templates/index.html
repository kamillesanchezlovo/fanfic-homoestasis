      <h1>Genesis</h1>
      <p class="quote-format">
        Genesis 3:4-5 “You will not certainly die,” the serpent said to the
        woman. “For God knows that when you eat from it, your eyes will be
        opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The nightmare starts the same way the others always do, with the hope
        that this time, somehow, things might be different.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jayce finds himself back within the old house’s enclosure, its abandoned
        walls disguised as ordinary brick. Dark clouds covered the moon, leaving
        only a faint trace of light to witness the crime scene.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everything is exactly as it was in the image burned into his memory—same
        branches swaying in the wind, barely scraping against his car window,
        same anemic moonlight, same unmarked vehicles lurking in the background.
        All but one detail.
      </p>
      <p>He peers at the scene and immediately identifies the flaw.</p>
      <p>
        The stone that forms the house is not smooth. It bulges with uneven
        lumps, a canvas for thousands of closed eyes barely distinguishable in
        the shadows, thick veins pulsing beneath their lids.
        <em>It sleeps now</em>, he accepts the thought without examining it.
      </p>
      <p>“Okay, wrap it up!” an agent calls from across the yard.</p>
      <p>
        As the midnight air bites at his neck, he feels youth settle back into
        his twenty-nine-year-old body, back when the only signs of age were the
        smile lines at his mouth and the world seemed yet unprepared for his
        skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tonight, that belief has teeth. He neutralized the anomaly, and the case
        is closing. His shoulders, for once, feel light.
        <em>It’s time to go home.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        “Come on, Jayce. This is probably going to be my only chance to get him
        alone.” Amaranthine’s voice rings out, and he turns to look at her; the
        sight feels like a stab in his chest.
      </p>
      <p>
        He fears he may be starting to forget her face, but the night terrors
        manage to preserve every detail, from the baby fat that hung in her
        cheeks to the mischievous smirk she always wore—his ingenuous protégée.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if it’s only a dream, he feels his own mind regressing. He can’t
        remember what made him agree to let her go; perhaps the reassurance that
        Professor Heimerdinger would be inside to receive her, or maybe the
        excitement that lit her eyes at what might have been her only chance to
        impress him with her investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Either way, he wants to claw at his own throat when he hears his
        response. He hears it as if from outside himself, wants to grab that
        earlier version of his body and shake it, to scream at him to take it
        back, to say anything else. “Just be quick.”
      </p>
      <p>
        She smiles at him, and he releases the warmth of her arm. “I’ll be right
        back.” He watches her slip away, her blonde head bobbing as she runs
        toward the house, right before the interior consumes her frame.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jayce waits twenty, maybe twenty-five minutes, his mind so far away he
        doesn’t notice the cold creeping deeper into the air, not until the car
        radio suddenly clicks on.
        <em
          >Or maybe it was always like that. Maybe the signs were there, and he
          failed to recognize them.</em
        >
        The thought that haunts him echoes in the reverie.
      </p>
      <p>
        The device emits a strange sound, broadcasting at an unknown frequency,
        too low to decipher, even for a man once trained to read signals as if
        they were a second language. He waits for another five minutes. The
        combination of sudden cold and static noise holds him there, motionless.
        It isn’t until he sees his own breath clouding in the frozen air that
        reality settles in.
      </p>
      <p>
        When he steps out of the car, he is met with black, empty pupils boring
        into his body. The walls have snapped their eyes open and fix him with
        an accusatory stare; for the first time, Jayce is actually seen. He
        cannot fathom how small he stands before the vast, lurking evil.
      </p>
      <p>
        What happens next comes only in fragments, memories his body recalls as
        spasms.
      </p>
      <p>
        When he tries to run inside the house, the door is sealed shut. He sees
        himself slamming against it until it gives, forcing his way in, shouting
        for help—the static rings against his ears, keeping him from realizing
        that everything else around him has gone silent, that every investigator
        who made up the backup is not coming back.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the room, the odor drowns every sense of direction he has, so he
        guides himself by the blackened blood streaking the halls. The metallic
        scent mingles with something putrid, a stench that feels as though the
        zone had somehow slipped beyond God’s reach.
      </p>
      <p>
        He finds the first piece of Amaranthine just two steps inside the living
        room—her foot. It is small, ghostly pale from drained circulation. His
        next moves feel deliberately automatic when he follows the trail deeper
        into the house. <em>A hand. An arm.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It all finally stops in a darkened room when he finds her head. Blonde
        hair clings to the nape where the cut is clean. Her flesh is still
        tender when he gathers what remains of her into his arms, but the warmth
        is gone. The dead eyes stare past him, blood and froth mingling from her
        mouth. Even now, he can read the terror that must have filled her final
        moments.
      </p>
      <p>
        What remains of her forms a deliberate path, leading him to
        Heimerdinger’s decimated corpse.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jayce’s hands are shaking as he pulls her close, trying to give her some
        of the life he no longer wants. When the car radio blares to life—ten
        times louder than before—he finally understands the message it’s trying
        to send: frantic laughter.
      </p>
      <p>
        His eyes snap open just as the scream is about to tear from his throat.
      </p>

          18 Lives Lost in Buffalo: The Gas Leak That Raised Questions
        </h2>
        <p class="newspaper-byline">By Felicia Wickham</p>
        <div class="newspaper-body">
          <p>
            A week has passed since the incident that shook the entire country:
            the sudden death of 18 citizens inside a warehouse located directly
            across from 2147 Glenmoor Avenue in Buffalo, New York.
          </p>
          <p>
            Following an intense wave of media coverage, the local police
            department has retreated from its initial claim that the deaths were
            somehow connected to the recent disappearances near Lake Erie. What
            first appeared to be a widening investigation has now concluded with
            the constabulary washing their hands of earlier implications.
          </p>
          <p>
            Public statements regarding the incident have become more
            restrained, and responsibility for further explanations appears to
            have shifted to a higher authority. After a controversial press
            conference, surprisingly led by the Federal Bureau of Investigation
            (FBI), the deaths were attributed to a gas leak originating from the
            abandoned house previously used as a warehouse.
          </p>
          <p>
            In an attempt to dispel secrecy surrounding the event, officials
            described the incident as a failure of proper safety protocols,
            allegedly resulting in a “mass poisoning” that left many victims
            disoriented and ultimately led to their drowning in the lake.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, what occurred inside the property remains unclear, as the
            structure was later set on fire, killing an older man—later
            identified as a private detective—and a young woman, a
            criminologist, who were reportedly searching for the source of the
            odor.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, we had the opportunity to meet with FBI Director Cassandra
            Kiramman, who, for the first time, answered any remaining questions
            regarding the tragedy.
          </p>
          <p class="newspaper-qa">
            <span class="newspaper-q">Q:</span> So, it seems to have been a
            difficult week for the agency.
          </p>
          <p class="newspaper-qa">
            <span class="newspaper-a">Kiramman:</span> It certainly has.
