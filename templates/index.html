        1 Peter 5:8-9: Warns to be sober and vigilant because the devil prowls
        around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour, and instructs
        believers to resist him.

        <strong class="start-letter">T</strong>he nightmare starts the same way
        the others always do, with the false hope that this time, somehow,
        things might be different.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jayce finds himself back within the old house’s enclosure, its abandoned
        walls disguised as plain brick. The image splits his mind in two, down to the root. A part of him hold onto what's in front of him, without sparing a single thought to the premonition The air is damp, In the dreams, the details always shift; this
        time, the stone is covered in a thousand closed eyes.
      </p>

      <p>“Okay, wrap it up!” an agent calls from across the yard.</p>

      <p>
        The midnight air bites at his neck, and he feels youth settle into his
        twenty-seven-year-old body. Back when the only signs of age were the
        smile lines at his mouth, when the world seemed unprepared for him—when
        his skills felt sufficient, and he believed himself smart.
      </p>

      <p>
        Tonight, that belief has teeth. The aberration is neutralized. The case
        is closed. His shoulders, for once, are light.
      </p>

      <p>It’s time to go home.</p>

      <p>
        “Come on, Jayce. This is probably going to be my only chance to get him
        alone.” Amaranthine’s voice rings out, and he turns to look at her, the
        sight feels like an ache on his chest.
      </p>

      <p>
        He fears he may be starting to forget her face, but the night terrors
        manage to preserve every detail, from the baby fat that hung in her
        cheeks to the mischievous smirk she always wore. His too-young,
        too-ingenuous protégée, the one he was meant to look after.
      </p>

      <p>Even if it’s only a dream, he feels his own mind regressing.</p>

      <p>
        He can’t remember what made him agree to let her go—perhaps the
        reassurance that professor Heimerdinger would be inside to receive her,
        or maybe the excitement that lit her eyes at what might have been her
        only chance to impress him with her investigation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Either way, he wants to claw at his own throat when he hears his voice
        mutter the response that would haunt him for years to come. He hears it
        as if from outside himself, wants to grab that earlier version of his
        body and shake it, to scream at him to take it back, to say anything
        else. “All right. Just be quick.”
      </p>

      <p>She smiles at him, and he releases the warmth of her hand.</p>

      <p>
        He watches her slip away, her blonde head bobbing as she runs toward the
        house, her frame swallowed by the darkness inside.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jayce waits twenty, maybe twenty-five minutes, too deep in thought to
        notice the cold creeping deeper into the air, until the car radio turns
        on—or maybe it never turned off. Maybe the signs were always there. The
        thought would haunt him forever.
      </p>

      <p>
        The device emits a strange noise, broadcasting at an unknown frequency,
        too deep to decipher, even for someone who reads signals like a second
        language.
      </p>

      <p>He sits motionless as reality settles in.</p>

      <p>
        The walls snap their eyes open. Their accusatory gaze fixes on him, and
        for the first time, Jayce is truly seen. He cannot comprehend how small
        he must appear before the vast, lurking evil.
      </p>

      <p>
        He tries to run back inside, but the door is sealed shut. What happens
        next comes only in fragments, memories his body recalls as spasms. He
        sees himself slamming against the door until it gives, forcing his way
        in, shouting for help—too late to realize everything has gone silent.
        Blackish blood streaks the halls. The metallic scent mixes with
        something sour, a stench that feels like fear made physical.
      </p>

      <p>
        He finds the first piece of Amaranthine just inside the hall—her foot.
        It is small, ghostly white from drained circulation. The horrifying
        sight tugs his heart.
      </p>

      <p>He follows the trail deeper into the house. A hand. An arm.</p>

      <p>
        In a darkened room, he finds her head. Blonde hair clings at the nape
        where the cut is clean.
      </p>

      <p>
        Her flesh is still tender when he gathers what remains of her into his
        arms, but the warmth is gone. Her dead eyes stare past him, blood and
        water mingling on her skin. Even now, he can read the terror that must
        have filled her final minutes.
      </p>

      <p>
        The rest of her forms a deliberate path, leading him back to
        Heimerdinger’s decimated corpse.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside, unaware, every investigator who made up the backup will later
        resurface from the lake as a corpse.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then the car radio blares to life, ten times louder than before. This
        time he understands the message it carries: frantic laughter.
      </p>

      <p>
        His eyes snap open just as the scream is about to tear from his throat.
      </p>

          12 Deaths Attributed to Gas Leak in Buffalo, New York
        </h2>
        <p class="newspaper-byline">By Seraphine Baker</p>
        <div class="newspaper-body">
          <p>
            A week has passed since the incident that shook the entire city: the
            sudden death of 13 citizens inside a warehouse located directly
            across from 2147 Glenmoor Avenue.
          </p>
          <p>
            Following an intense wave of media coverage, the local police
            department’s initial claim, suggesting the deaths might be connected
            to the recent disappearances near Lake Erie, has now shifted. What
            first appeared to be a bigger investigation washing their hands from
            earlier implications. Public statements regarding the incident
            gradually became more restrained, and responsibility for further
            communication seemed to move into the hands of a higher authority.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, we had the opportunity to meet with FBI Director Kate Porter,
            who is, for the first time, giving testimony regarding the incident.
          </p>
          <p class="newspaper-qa">
            <span class="newspaper-q">Q:</span> Were there prior warnings about
            the warehouse conditions?
